Hello everyone! I started with Flatiron in January with the Self Paced program, but quickly learned this program wasn’t the right fit for me. Before I dig into the details, let me explain a little about myself. 

I graduated from the University of Dayton (go Flyers!) in 2012 with dual degrees in Accounting and Music. While still enjoying music as a hobby, I worked in corporate accounting for 5 years. For multiple reasons, I never felt like this was something I wanted to do as a career as it was the same thing every month and not challenging. 

So in December 2017 I quit my job!  I backpacked through 13 countries in Asia and Europe and loved it. Ironically, I was supposed to attend a grad program in March 2018 for Data Science, but withdrew my acceptance due to cost and wanting to prolong my trip.  I returned to the US at the end of last year and started looking into jobs that offered remote work so I can ultimately continue to travel and see new places and cultures. Programming was in the top of every list. 

I picked the Self Paced option and naively thought I could fly through the material and get a job as quickly as possible. After a month it was evident that I was not learning as fast as I wanted to and I easily became frustrated with having to wait in the potentially long queue for Ask A Question  pairing or delay my progress a few days for a relevant study group to occur. With no programming experience, I also was worried I did not have the aptitude to complete the program and I wasn’t sure if I was the only one struggling. While the Self Paced Program may have been a better fit for someone with coding experience or working full time in addition to learning code, this was not the case for me. 

I spoke with Admissions on a Friday about my concerns and they suggested I switch over to a Full Time cohort starting on Monday. Many people were involved in the quick turnaround and I was ready to go in time! 

Ever since I made the switch, I have been really happy with my decision. I know the program will be ending in mid July, my classmates and instructor are awesome (shout out to the 2/11 !Slackers), and I am receiving the more immediate help I need. The cohort’s study groups meet often and in these sessions my classmates ask questions that I haven’t even thought of. It’s a less lonely world in the Full Time program!
