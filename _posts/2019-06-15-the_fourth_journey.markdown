To recap, my Rails project was about restaurant having many menu items, with users being able to add either. For my fourth project, I added some additional features. Users can now add items, and see items for a certain restaurant or individual item detail, without having to refresh the restaurant pages or go to the item pages. 

After looking at labs and trying to incorporate the patterns into my Rails project, I was able to meet the minimum requirements using jQuery on only Tuesday! I had the instructor to myself early on in the week and asked my questions. I only had to do a recording of how my app works and a blog post. My instructor had sent out an extra project so I thought I would take a look at that as well. The rest of the week should be a breeze, right?! Wrong! 

Since there were multiple ways to complete this project, I decided to dig into ‘fetch’ to see what it was all about. I learned that we were not allowed to use jQuery on our last project, so I should at least familiarize with the main concepts. Why not use my comfortable Rails project to play around with? 

One of my biggest takeaways from this project was how to use Google and Youtube. I found the lesson about fetch from Learnco was incoherent and incomplete, and it was really hard to piece together what I was supposed to do with the project. It took me over a day how to use ‘post’ with fetch, even with my instructor’s guidance and my best Googling skills. I am glad I had the time to look at this now, rather than during the last project. Hopefully in the next section, there is more information and a clearer explanation of this concept.
