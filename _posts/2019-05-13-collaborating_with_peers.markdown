Over the last break, me and a few of my classmates had the opportunity to collaborate and create a Rails project from scratch. This was eye opening and I learned a ton from my classmates, especially how to work with Github and front-end development. As we know, there many different ways to do things so it was really cool seeing peers code in more efficient and DRY ways than me. 

Specifically, I learned about Github commands that I would have not been able to learn realistically by myself. For example, in order to create a branch, the command is “git checkout -b name_of_branch”. Then code, add, and commit as you normally would. If your team likes what you have done, in order to push your branch into the master, the command is “git push -u origin name_of_branch.” 

Another useful command is when other edits have been made to the master, and you would like to have the latest copy on your machine to work off of. For this, the command is “git pull origin master.” These are the three main commands I have learned, and could definitely use more practice when it comes to issues with merging branches and other complications.

For me personally, an area of improvement is frontend development. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to contribute much as it took a lot of time to do minimal styling changes, but I did learn a lot from what my classmates did. For my solo Rails project, I want to focus on this and I also would like to finish the Bonus HTML and CSS sections before the course ends in July.
