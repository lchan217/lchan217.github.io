It's hard to believe we are actually more than half way through the program. The third project was by far the most challenging and complex.

My project is all about restaurants and users can add restaurants with multiple locations and items. Users can perform the whole crud cycle on restaurants and items, with items as a nested route for restaurants. Users can sign up by creating a username and password, and they can also log in using Github.

For me, the struggle was finding the models that fit the requirements of the project. Because I didn't fully understand  how my models related to each other, it was hard to determine an end goal and the obstacles snowballed from the very beginning. I definitely felt the time crunch this project more than the others. In the end I eventually had to stop coding, and I will have to come back to it at a later time with fresh eyes.

For the next project, I want to carefully outline steps along the way and define what the result should be before I even start coding. It will help me determine any issues from the very beginning and time is not wasted trying to make my views show what I want by manipulating the code in weird ways. 

Aside from these struggles, I attended more study sessions for help, and I also got to see and help other talented students. The bond and support within my cohort is amazing and there's usually someone available to help. Even if you don't find the solution, it's always nice to know you're not going crazy and you usually have some progress or a new approach to your bug.
