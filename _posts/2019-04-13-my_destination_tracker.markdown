Since I have a love of travel, I decided to make my project all about places. This program allows users to track destinations that they have visited as well as destinations they would like to visit in the future. They can fill out the city, country, date visited, and what they did/what they want to do. It’s a great place to log memories! 

Before starting this project, I was not comfortable with the Sinatra material at all since it was A LOT to learn in just a week. I took the time to write out all the methods and routes and paired with two classmates on the Fwitter lab. These both really helped me solidify my understanding of the material.

To begin the project, I installed the miraculous Corneal gem, which sets up the Sinatra folders and most of initial paths. Highly recommend! 

I got to work setting up the signing up and logging in routes, then moved onto the CRUD part of my models using my handwritten notes. I started with a way to keep track of past trips, and once this was finished I implemented the future trips portion. One thing that helped me was by typing in “did we get here?” in the file where I wanted to go. At first, I usually never got where I wanted to go, but improved tremendously by the end of the project.

This was my first real experience with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. In the next weeks, I will go over the Flatiron material on HTML and CSS, as well as FreeCodeCamp.org. This was definitely one of my weakest parts of the project, and I plan on tweaking my project after the due date once I have learned more about these topics.
